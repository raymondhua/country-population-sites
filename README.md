# web-3

For one of my papers in my final year, I created two web applications that share the same front-end with different back-end technology and databases, for the front-end uses JavaScript to display its output.

This application uses a CSV of the world population of each decade from 1960 to 2016 that gets executed (and deleted if there are any existing data) in the database with one click. The front-end of the website fetches the API of the world population to display a graph of a particular country over a period. I used the JavaScript library D3.js to display the visualisation.

flaskr uses Flask as a web framework and MongoDB as a database.

postgres uses Express and Node.js as its back-end frameworks and Postgres as its database.
